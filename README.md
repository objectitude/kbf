Key Bit Foundry: password (re)generator

We all know that we should have a different password per login but our brain is not made to memorize 20, 30 or 100 passwords or PINs.
This small tool allow to generate passwords and PINs from a (personal) receipe and a absolutely secret password (or several). If one forget the password for a given login, select the right receipe, provide your A.S.P. :-) and you are done.

I created this tool 10 years ago and I eventually decided to share with all of you.
